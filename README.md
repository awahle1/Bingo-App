Thank you so much for an awesome course, I learned so much

This project is a social media platform where the posts are bingo boards. You can make boards, fill them out, share them with your friends, and so on.

Files

base.html - Contains boilerplate code ex: linking css sheets, bootstrap
bingos.html - Display's the signed in user's bingos
boardmaker.html - The form for creating a board
boards.html - Shows the boards that the user created and allows the user to fill out the boards
feed.html - shows the 20 most recent boards that people you are following have made
login.html - login form
message.html - template for showing user messages
profile.html - the top section of the signed in user's profile: Title, navigation bar, username and parent of base, bingo, and search
search.html - search bar to explore other profiles
results.html - extends search, shows the results of the search
searchbase.html - I tried to be clever naming here. It is like a mix of base.html and profile.html, but for other user's profile's
signup.html - sign up form
user prefix - The user prefix just means that the file pertains to content of other users
